  <center><h1>STRESS</h1></center>
  <h2 style="font-size: 20px">
    Stress can affect anyone, but specific types of stress are more common among
    certain groups of people or professions due to the unique challenges they
    face. Below is a breakdown of stress types, the people commonly affected,
    and examples of jobs or roles associated with each. THERE ARE 4 TYPES
  </h2>

  <CENTER><h2 style="font-size: 50px;padding: 100px;">PTSD</h2></CENTER>
  <h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">PTSD occurs when the brain struggles to process a traumatic experience, leaving the individual in a heightened state of fear or stress long after the event has passed. The disorder can affect anyone, but it is particularly common among:

Military personnel
First responders
Survivors of abuse, violence, or disasters
Witnesses of traumatic events
Symptoms of PTSD
PTSD symptoms are generally categorized into four groups:
</h3>
<h2>Intrusion Symptoms:</h2>
<h3>Flashbacks of the traumatic event.
Nightmares or distressing dreams.
Intense emotional or physical reactions to reminders of the trauma (e.g., hearing loud noises, certain smells).
Avoidance Symptoms:
</h3>
<h3>Avoiding places, people, or activities that trigger memories of the trauma.
Suppressing thoughts or feelings about the event.
Negative Changes in Mood or Cognition:
</h3>
<h3>Persistent feelings of guilt, shame, or fear.
Difficulty remembering parts of the traumatic event.
Loss of interest in activities or feelings of detachment from others.
Arousal and Reactivity Symptoms:</h3>
<h3>Hypervigilance (constant sense of danger).
Irritability, anger outbursts, or aggression.
Difficulty concentrating or sleeping.
Risk Factors for PTSD
Severity of Trauma: More intense or prolonged trauma increases the risk.
Personal History: Previous trauma or mental health issues can elevate susceptibility.
Support Systems: A lack of social support can worsen symptoms.
Profession: Jobs with exposure to life-threatening situations (e.g., soldiers, police officers) carry higher risks.</h3>
<CENTER><h2>PHASES OF PTSD</h2></CENTER>
<h3>Impact Phase:

Occurs immediately after the traumatic event.
Symptoms like shock, fear, and confusion dominate.</h3>
<h2>Denial Phase:</h2>
<h3>
Individuals may avoid processing the trauma or deny its impact.
Short-Term Recovery Phase: 
Symptoms of hypervigilance, nightmares, and emotional instability emerge as the brain struggles to adjust.
</h3>
<h2>
Chronic Phase:</h2>


<h3>Prolonged symptoms affecting daily life, potentially leading to other issues like depression or substance abuse.
Related Stress Disorders</h3>
<h2>Acute Stress Disorder (ASD):</h2>
<h3>Similar to PTSD but symptoms last for a shorter duration (less than one month after the event).
May develop into PTSD if left untreated.</h3>
<h2>Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):</h2>
<h3>Occurs after prolonged exposure to trauma, such as ongoing abuse or captivity.
Involves symptoms of PTSD along with emotional dysregulation, relationship difficulties, and distorted self-perception.
Adjustment Disorders:</h3>
<h3>Emotional or behavioral responses to identifiable stressors that are out of proportion to the severity of the event.
Symptoms subside once the stressor is removed.
How PTSD Affects the Brain
Amygdala: Overactivity leads to heightened fear and emotional responses.
Prefrontal Cortex: Underactivity reduces the brain's ability to regulate emotions and rationalize fear.
Hippocampus: Reduced volume may impair memory and the ability to differentiate between past and present threats.
Treatment Options for PTSD</h3>
<h2>Therapies:</h2>
<h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Focuses on reframing negative thoughts and beliefs.
Exposure Therapy: Gradual exposure to trauma-related triggers in a controlled environment.
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): Uses guided eye movements to process traumatic memories.</h3>
<h2>Medications:</h2>
<h3>SSRIs and SNRIs: Antidepressants like sertraline or venlafaxine are commonly prescribed.
Prazosin: May help reduce nightmares.
Lifestyle Changes:

Regular exercise and mindfulness techniques.
Building strong support networks.
Limiting exposure to triggers when possible.
Support Groups:

Sharing experiences with others who have faced similar traumas.
Prevention and Coping Strategies
Early Intervention: Seeking help immediately after a traumatic event may prevent PTSD.
Stress Management: Techniques like meditation, yoga, or journaling.
Professional Support: Regular counseling or therapy sessions.
Building Resilience: Developing a strong sense of purpose and community.</h3>

<h2>Eustress</h2>
<h3>Selye published in year 1975 a model dividing stress into eustress and distress. Where stress enhances function (physical or mental, such as through strength training or challenging work), it may be considered eustress. Persistent stress that is not resolved through coping or adaptation, deemed distress, may lead to anxiety or withdrawal (depression) behavior.

The difference between experiences that result in eustress and those that result in distress is determined by the disparity between an experience (real or imagined) and personal expectations, and resources to cope with the stress. Alarming experiences, either real or imagined, can trigger a stress response</h3>
<h2>Coping</h2>
<h3>Responses to stress include adaptation, psychological coping such as stress management, anxiety, and depression. Over the long term, distress can lead to diminished health and/or increased propensity to illness; to avoid this, stress must be managed.</h3>
<h3>Stress management encompasses techniques intended to equip a person with effective coping mechanisms for dealing with psychological stress, with stress defined as a person's physiological response to an internal or external stimulus that triggers the fight-or-flight response. Stress management is effective when a person uses strategies to cope with or alter stressful situations.</h3>
<h3>There are several ways of coping with stress such as controlling the source of stress or learning to set limits and to say "no" to some of the demands that bosses or family members may make.</h3>
<h3>A person's capacity to tolerate the source of stress may be increased by thinking about another topic such as a hobby, listening to music, or spending time in a wilderness.</h3>
<h3>A way to control stress is first dealing with what is causing the stress if it is something the individual has control over. Other methods to control stress and reduce it can be: to not procrastinate and leave tasks for the last minute, do things you like, exercise, do breathing routines, go out with friends, and take a break. Having support from a loved one also helps a lot in reducing stress.</h3>
<h3>One study showed that the power of having support from a loved one, or just having social support, lowered stress in individual subjects. Painful shocks were applied to married women's ankles. In some trials women were able to hold their husband's hand, in other trials they held a stranger's hand, and then held no one's hand. When the women were holding their husband's hand, the response was reduced in many brain areas. When holding the stranger's hand the response was reduced a little, but not as much as when they were holding their husband's hand. Social support helps reduce stress and even more so if the support is from a loved one.</h3>
<h2>Cognitive appraisal</h2>
<h3> in order for a psychosocial situation to be stressful, it must be appraised as such that cognitive processes of appraisal are central in determining whether a situation is potentially threatening, constitutes a harm/loss or a challenge, or is benign. </h3>
<h3>Both personal and environmental factors influence this primary appraisal, which then triggers the selection of coping processes. Problem-focused coping is directed at managing the problem, whereas emotion-focused coping processes are directed at managing the negative emotions. Secondary appraisal refers to the evaluation of the resources available to cope with the problem, and may alter the primary appraisal.</h3>
<h3>In other words, primary appraisal includes the perception of how stressful the problem is and the secondary appraisal of estimating whether one has more than or less than adequate resources to deal with the problem that affects the overall appraisal of stressfulness. Further, coping is flexible in that, in general, the individual examines the effectiveness of the coping on the situation; if it is not having the desired effect, they will, in general, try different strategies.[</h3>
<h2>General adaptation syndrome</h2>
<h3>Physiologists define stress as how the body reacts to a stressor - a stimulus, real or imagined. Acute stressors affect an organism in the short term; chronic stressors over the longer term. The general adaptation syndrome (GAS), developed by Hans Selye, is a profile of how organisms respond to stress; GAS is characterized by three phases: a nonspecific alarm mobilization phase, which promotes sympathetic nervous system activity; a resistance phase, during which the organism makes efforts to cope with the threat; and an exhaustion phase, which occurs if the organism fails to overcome the threat and depletes its physiological resources.[</h3>
<h1>Stage 1</h1>
<h3>Alarm is the first stage, which is divided into two phases: the shock phase and the antishock phase</h3>
<h2>Shock phase</h2>
<h3>During this phase, the body can endure changes such as hypovolemia, hypoosmolarity, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypoglycemiaâ€”the stressor effect. This phase resembles Addison's disease. The organism's resistance to the stressor drops temporarily below the normal range and some level of shock (e.g. circulatory shock) may be experienced.</h3>
<h2>Antishock phase</h2>
<h3>When the threat or stressor is identified or realized, the body starts to respond and is in a state of alarm. During this stage, the locus coeruleus and sympathetic nervous system activate the production of catecholamines including adrenaline, engaging the popularly-known fight-or-flight response. Adrenaline temporarily provides increased muscular tonus, increased blood pressure due to peripheral vasoconstriction and tachycardia, and increased glucose in blood. There is also some activation of the HPA axis, producing glucocorticoids (cortisol, aka the S-hormone or stress-hormone).</h3>
<h1>Stage 2</h1>
<h3>Resistance is the second stage. During this stage, increased secretion of glucocorticoids intensifies the body's systemic response. Glucocorticoids can increase the concentration of glucose, fat, and amino acid in blood. In high doses, one glucocorticoid, cortisol, begins to act similarly to a mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) and brings the body to a state similar to hyperaldosteronism. If the stressor persists, it becomes necessary to attempt some means of coping with the stress. The body attempts to respond to stressful stimuli, but after prolonged activation, the body's chemical resources will be gradually depleted, leading to the final stage.
</h3>
<h1>Stage 3</h1>
<h2>Recovery</h2>
<h3>stage follows when the system's compensation mechanisms have successfully overcome the stressor effect (or have completely eliminated the factor which caused the stress). The high glucose, fat and amino acid levels in blood prove useful for anabolic reactions, restoration of homeostasis and regeneration of cells.</h3>
<h2>Exhaustion</h2>
<h3> is the alternative third stage in the GAS model. At this point, all of the body's resources are eventually depleted and the body is unable to maintain normal function. The initial autonomic nervous system symptoms may reappear (panic attacks, muscle aches, sore eyes, difficulty breathing, fatigue, heartburn, high blood pressure, and difficulty sleeping, etc.). If stage three is extended, long-term damage may result (prolonged vasoconstriction results in ischemia which in turn leads to cell necrosis), as the body's immune system becomes exhausted, and bodily functions become impaired, resulting in decompensation.</h3>
<h4>The result can manifest itself in obvious illnesses, such as general trouble with the digestive system (e.g. occult bleeding, melena, constipation/obstipation), diabetes, or even cardiovascular problems (angina pectoris), along with clinical depression and other mental illnesses</h4>

<center><h2>Mental Health promotion and Prevention</h2></center>
<h3>Promotion and prevention interventions work by identifying the individual, social and structural determinants of mental health, and then intervening to reduce risks, build resilience and establish supportive environments for mental health. Interventions can be designed for individuals, specific groups or whole populations.</h3>
<h3>Reshaping the determinants of mental health often requires action beyond the health sector and so promotion and prevention programmes should involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors. The health sector can contribute significantly by embedding promotion and prevention efforts within health services; and by advocating, initiating and, where appropriate, facilitating multisectoral collaboration and coordination.</h3>
<h3>
Suicide prevention is a global priority and included in the Sustainable Development Goals. Much progress can be achieved by limiting access to means, responsible media reporting, social and emotional learning for adolescents and early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and costâ€“effective intervention for reducing suicide rates.</h3>
<h3>Promoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority and can be achieved by policies and laws that promote and protect mental health, supporting caregivers to provide nurturing care, implementing school-based programmes and improving the quality of community and online environments. School-based social and emotional learning programmes are among the most effective promotion strategies for countries at all income levels.</h3>
<h3>Promoting and protecting mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can be supported through legislation and regulation, organizational strategies, manager training and interventions for workers.</h3>
